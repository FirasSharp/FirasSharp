# Hello World! ðŸ˜‹

*I am Firas Jelassi a full stack Developer who loves Software and web development, has an interest in Cybersecurity and a huge Hobby in Mixing music.*

## About Me
I don't like to talk much about my self, this is why all i will say is that, I love making friends and interacting with people, I like to programm and I am huge fan of the Open Source, I am slowly starting to contribute to it.

## Skills
Well, first I would like to say that tools are just that, tools. My idea is all tools can get the job done as long as you choose the right stack, so here I am listing my skills, but I'll have no problem working using for example a language that I have never used before. Learning is fun.
