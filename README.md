# Hello World! ðŸ˜‹

*I am Firas Jelassi a full stack Developer who loves Software and web development, has an interest in Cybersecurity and a huge Hobby in Mixing music.*

## About Me
I don't like to talk much about myself, this is why all I will say is that I love making friends and interacting with people; I like to program and I am a huge fan of the Open Source, and I am slowly starting to contribute to it. In my free time, I like to hang out with friends and family, play video games, program, and mix music (mainly techno).

## Skills
Well, first I would like to say that tools are just that, tools. My idea is all tools can get the job done as long as you choose the right stack, so here I am listing my skills, but I'll have no problem working using for example a language that I have never used before. Learning is fun.
